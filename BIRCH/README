./birch is the BIRCH executable compiled in Linux.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running BIRCH:
There are 4 files involved in input for each execution:
and I have put some samples in the directory.

An example command for running birch on the sample.data data file:
./birch sample.para sample.scheme sample.proj sample.data

sample.para	parameter settings of birch as mentioned 
		in SIGMOD paper [1]. 	 
		it is explained in "para.config" with those places that 
		you might need to change specifically commented.

sample.scheme	scheme description of the data set as mentioned
		in SIGMOD paper.

sample.proj	projection file of the data set as mentioned
		in SIGMOD paper.
		each line is a projection, and each projection is used to 
		build tree and do clustering.

sample.data		data set (ASCII format)

The output file containing cluster is:
sample.para+sample.scheme+sample.proj+sample.data-0-cluster

Fomat of the above file:
1. Each line represents a cluster.
2. Each line has the following:
No. Points	---	Mean vector	---	\sigma^2

For the convinience of the user we have written a small shell script which prepares the para, scheme, proj files.
It is "prepInput.sh". The user need to change only the following parameters:
1. K (see line no.1) --- More the value of K more the number of leaves in the BIRCH tree. Hence more clusters and vice-versa.
2. K1 (see line no.2) --- The final number of clusters which the BIRCH should output.
If K1=500, then sample.para+sample.scheme+sample.proj+sample.data-0-cluster will have 500 lines.
Ensure that K > K1.
3. n (see line no.3) --- dimensionality of the training examples.
The prepInput.sh script produces three files: p.para, p.scheme and p.proj files.
genPara.awk and para.template are two files used by prepInput.sh and need not be used by the user.
